The Binary files for various tasks have been created by converting the Assembly language manually. The emulator takes this binary file as input anb displays the output in a similar fashion as shown by a 7 segment display we have in the physical processor.

```
cd bin
./main.exe fib.bin // this runs the fibonacci series program.
```
