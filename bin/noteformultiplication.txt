FOR MULTIPLICATION DUE TO THE CARRY AND ZERO FLAG IN OUR EMULATOR
WE GET product = (x-1) * y

So to get a product for 3 and 5 
assign x = 4
and y =5

THis is due to the fact the 
we first subtract the value of x 
Iteration 1 : 3 - 1 =2
Iteration 2: 2 - 1 = 1

Iteration 3: 1 - 1 = 0 and Zero flag is set immediately and program halts.
